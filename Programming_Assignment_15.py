
**Question 1**:
```python
def divisible_by_5_and_7(n):
    for i in range(n+1):
        if i % 5 == 0 and i % 7 == 0:
            yield i

n = int(input("Enter the value of n: "))
print(",".join(str(x) for x in divisible_by_5_and_7(n)))
```
Explanation:
- The `divisible_by_5_and_7` function is a generator that yields the numbers between 0 and `n` that are divisible by both 5 and 7.
- The function uses a `for` loop to iterate through the range from 0 to `n` (inclusive), and checks if the current number `i` is divisible by both 5 and 7 using the modulo operator `%`.
- If the condition is met, the function `yield`s the current number `i`.
- The `print` statement then joins all the yielded numbers into a comma-separated string using a list comprehension and the `join()` method.

**Question 2**:
```python
def even_numbers(n):
    for i in range(n+1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            yield i

n = int(input("Enter the value of n: "))
print(",".join(str(x) for x in even_numbers(n)))
```
Explanation:
- The `even_numbers` function is a generator that yields the even numbers between 0 and `n`.
- The function uses a `for` loop to iterate through the range from 0 to `n` (inclusive), and checks if the current number `i` is even using the modulo operator `%`.
- If the condition is met, the function `yield`s the current number `i`.
- The `print` statement then joins all the yielded numbers into a comma-separated string using a list comprehension and the `join()` method.

**Question 3**:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

n = int(input("Enter the value of n: "))
print(",".join(str(fibonacci(i)) for i in range(n+1)))
```
Explanation:
- The `fibonacci` function is a recursive function that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to the `n`th term.
- The function first checks the base cases: if `n` is 0, it returns 0; if `n` is 1, it returns 1.
- For all other values of `n`, the function recursively calculates the `(n-1)`th and `(n-2)`th Fibonacci numbers and adds them together to get the `n`th Fibonacci number.
- The `print` statement then creates a list of Fibonacci numbers up to the `n`th term using a list comprehension, and joins them into a comma-separated string.

**Question 4**:
```python
def extract_username(email):
    # Assuming the email is in the format "<username@companyname.com>"
    start = email.index('<') + 1
    end = email.index('@')
    return email[start:end]

email = input("Enter the email address: ")
print(extract_username(email))
```
Explanation:
- The `extract_username` function takes an email address as input and returns the username part of the email.
- The function assumes that the email address is in the format `"<username@companyname.com>"`.
- It uses the `index()` method to find the starting and ending indices of the username, and then slices the email string to extract the username.
- The `print` statement simply calls the `extract_username` function with the input email address and prints the resulting username.

**Question 5**:
```python
class Shape:
    def __init__(self):
        self.area = 0

    def print_area(self):
        print("The area of the shape is:", self.area)

class Square(Shape):
    def __init__(self, length):
        super().__init__()
        self.length = length
        self.area = length * length

# Example usage
square = Square(5)
square.print_area()
```
Explanation:
- The `Shape` class is the base class, and it has an `__init__` method that initializes the `area` attribute to 0. It also has a `print_area` method that prints the area of the shape.
- The `Square` class is a subclass of `Shape`. It has an `__init__` method that takes a `length` argument and calls the `__init__` method of the `Shape` class using `super().__init__()`. It then calculates the area of the square (length * length) and assigns it to the `area` attribute.
- In the example usage, we create a `Square` object with a length of 5, and then call the `print_area` method, which will print the area of the square (25).
