1. The two values of the Boolean data type are `True` and `False`. They are written in all capital letters.

2. The three different types of Boolean operators are:
   - Logical AND (`and`)
   - Logical OR (`or`)
   - Logical NOT (`not`)

3. Here are the truth tables for the Boolean operators:

   | Operator | Truth Table |
   | --- | --- |
   | `and` | `True and True = True`<br>`True and False = False`<br>`False and True = False`<br>`False and False = False` |
   | `or` | `True or True = True`<br>`True or False = True`<br>`False or True = True`<br>`False or False = False` |
   | `not` | `not True = False`<br>`not False = True` |

4. The values of the given expressions are:

   - `(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)` evaluates to `False`
   - `not (5 > 4)` evaluates to `False`
   - `(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)` evaluates to `True`
   - `not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))` evaluates to `False`
   - `(True and True) and (True == False)` evaluates to `False`
   - `(not False) or (not True)` evaluates to `True`

5. The six comparison operators are:
   - Equal to (`==`)
   - Not equal to (`!=`)
   - Greater than (`>`)
   - Less than (`<`)
   - Greater than or equal to (`>=`)
   - Less than or equal to (`<=`)

6. The equal to (`==`) operator is used for comparison, while the assignment operator (`=`) is used to assign a value to a variable. For example:

   ```
   x = 5  # Assignment operator, assigns the value 5 to the variable x
   if x == 5:  # Comparison operator, checks if the value of x is equal to 5
       print("x is equal to 5")
   ```

7. The three blocks in the given code are:

   ```python
   spam = 0

   if spam == 10:
       print('eggs')

   if spam > 5:
       print('bacon')
   else:
       print('ham')

   print('spam')
   print('spam')
   ```

8. Here's the code that prints the appropriate message based on the value of `spam`:

   ```python
   if spam == 1:
       print('Hello')
   elif spam == 2:
       print('Howdy')
   else:
       print('Greetings!')
   ```

9. If your program is stuck in an endless loop, you can press `Ctrl + C` to interrupt the execution and stop the program.

10. The `break` statement is used to exit the loop, while the `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration and move to the next one.

11. The differences between the three `range()` functions are:
    - `range(10)` generates the sequence `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9`.
    - `range(0, 10)` generates the same sequence as `range(10)`.
    - `range(0, 10, 1)` also generates the same sequence as `range(10)` and `range(0, 10)`, as the step size of 1 is the default.

12. Here's the code for the two programs:

    Using a `for` loop:
    ```python
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(i)
    ```

    Using a `while` loop:
    ```python
    i = 1
    while i <= 10:
        print(i)
        i += 1
    ```

13. To call the `bacon()` function from the `spam` module, you would use the following syntax:

    ```python
    import spam
    spam.bacon()
    ```
